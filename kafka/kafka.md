# 1. Meet Kafka
## Publish/Subscribe Messaging
*Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging* is a pattern that is charachterized by the sender (publisher) of a piece of data (messge) not specificially directing it to a receiver. 
### How it starts
The need for publish/subscribe messaging system often arises when we have to cetralise&simplify the process of communication of many services/entities of one group with many those of an another group.
### Individual Queue Systems
It's useful to have one centralised messaging sustem than to have a few for different cases, because it supports scaling of functionality much better, and the maintaining proccess is more straightforward.
## Enter Kafka
Kafka is build as a reliable publish/subscribe messaging system, designed to consistently store messaged data, which is safely stored and can be read deterministically.
### Messages and batches

### Schemas
### Topics and Partitions
### Producers and Consumers
### Brokers and Clusters
### Multiple Clusters
